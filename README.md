# NBAPredictionModel
This project used Python, pandas, plotlyexpress, a web scrap of VegasInsider.com, and an NBA api to compute a winning team, winning margin and total points scored for any NBA matchup.

All results files (results.txt, simEvaluation.txt, first_figure.html, second_figure.html) are example outputs from running main.py and running all simulations for 03-01-2021 when prompted for input.
